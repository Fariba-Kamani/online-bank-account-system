Testing was ongoing throughout the entire project development. Chrome DevTools were used while building to find and resolve any issues and to ensure that everything was working correctly as expected. The same tools were also employed to verify that the project is responsive, visually appealing, and functions as intended on all standard screen sizes. The website was tested on the following browsers on a VivoBook Asus laptop: Chrome (version: 129.0.6668.100 (Official Build) (64-bit)), Microsoft Edge (version: 129.0.2792.89 (Official build) (64-bit)), Opera One (version: 114.0.5282.102), and Firefox (version: 131.0.3 (64-bit)). I tested the responsiveness and browser compatibility of my website on various screen sizes and devices by inspecting it on the mentioned browsers' equivalent DevTools. The website proved to be responsive and compatible with all the tested browsers. Additionally, I tested the project on Chrome browser on iPhone 13 and iPhone 14. The website worked as expected and was responsive and compatible with both devices. Furthermore, a few friends conducted additional testing on both Android and iOS mobile devices.
